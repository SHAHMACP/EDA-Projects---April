# **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects**

Welcome to the EDA Projects repository! This collection features various projects focused on **Exploratory Data Analysis**, a critical step in the data science workflow that involves summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset using **visualization, statistics, and storytelling**.

## **What is EDA?**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is the process of:
- **Understanding** the data structure and patterns
- **Identifying** anomalies, missing values, and outliers
- **Uncovering** relationships between variables
- **Visualizing** distributions and trends
- **Informing** further modeling or hypothesis testing

EDA helps data scientists and analysts make sense of data before diving into more complex modeling tasks.



## **Tools Used**
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Scikit-learn (for preprocessing)**


## **Contributing**
Feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request with your own EDA project or improvements!
